/*-----------------ROB-A-BANK--------------*/

1.	This is a 2 player rpg game for robbing a bank. Player 1 is a robber and Player 2 is a
getaway driver.
	Each player will try to steal more money than the other, and whoever steals the most without
getting caught at the end wins.

2.	The players will answer riddles/ scenarios in order to steal the money or
get away from the cops, and if they answer correctly the money is theirs. 
However, they still need to escape thecops.
	The getaway car is waiting for them outside the bank, and the police are
a random distance away. Each car has a random velocity, and if the cops catch
up with the robbers before the game times out, they lose. If the robbers make
it away from the cops before time ends, they win and get to keep their money.

3.	If the player is caught, he/she goes to jail and automatically loses. 
The player with the most money at the end wins!
