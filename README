/*-----------------ROB-A-BANK--------------*/

1.	This is a 2 player rpg game where both players are robbers. Each player will
try to steal more money than the other, and whoever steals the most without
getting caught at the end of the game wins. 

2.	The players will answer riddles in order to steal the money, and if they
answer correctly the money is theirs. However, they still need to escape the
cops. The getaway car is waiting for them outside the bank, and the police are
a random distance away. Each car has a random velocity, and if the cops catch
up with the robbers before the game times out, they lose. If the robbers make
it away from the cops before time ends, they win and get to keep their money.

3.	If the robber is caught, he/she goes to jail and automatically loses.
//OR-after one bank robbery (level 1/2/or 3, the robber gets to hide their
money and keeps it even though he went to jail?...maybe more complicated, but
fun). The player with the most money at the end wins!
